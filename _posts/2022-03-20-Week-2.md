-LAYER 6 Presentation
	Packages the data in a standardised format. Performs compression, encryption and additoinal transformations of the data if called for.
    
-LAYER 5 Session
	Determines whether it can establish a connection between networked devices. 
    
-LAYER 4 Transport
	Used to determine protocol by which data will be transported/transmitted.
    
-LAYER 3 Network
	Framework for establishing the route data will travel along the network. 
    
-LAYER 2 Data Link
	Packages the data in format for transmission. Sends data as well as verifying that data has not been corrupted during transmission. Layer responsible for adding the physical MAC address of the receiving endpoint.
    
-LAYER 1 Physical
	Pertains to the physical components/hardware of a device that receieves and sends, converts and interprets the electrical pulses sent over the network.
